This library provides convenient access to [GeoRSS](http://www.georss.org/) Feeds.


## Installation
`pip install georss-client`

## Usage
See below for examples of how this library can be used for particular GeoRSS feeds. After instantiating a particular class and supply the required parameters, you can call `update` to retrieve the feed data. The return value will be a tuple of a status code and the actual data in the form of a list of feed entries specific to the selected feed.

Status Codes
* _UPDATE_OK_: Update went fine and data was retrieved. The library may still return empty data, for example because no entries fulfilled the filter criteria.
* _UPDATE_OK_NO_DATA_: Update went fine but no data was retrieved, for example because the server indicated that there was not update since the last request.
* _UPDATE_ERROR_: Something went wrong during the update

## Supported GeoRSS Feeds

### Generic Feed

**Supported Filters**

| Filter |                         | Description |
